### DOWNLOADS
* [P5.js](http://p5js.org/) - Requests random images from StyleGAN and saves them to your computer
* [Runway](https://runwayml.com/) - Generates the StyleGAN images for P5
* [P5 Dom](https://p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.dom) - Allows you to save files from P5 canvas images
* [Toxic Libs](http://haptic-data.com/toxiclibsjs) - Generates the simplex noise in order to randomize our images

## INSTRUCTIONS

* Download, install and run Runway 
* Download P5, P5 Dom, and ToxicLibs
* Create a workspace in runway running StyleGAN
* In runway under styleGAN options, click Network, then click "Run Remotely"
* Open the `index.html` file from the github repo in your browser.
* To output a video from Runway, choose Output > Video and give it a place to save and select your desired frame rate.
* To output a video from Processing, turn the images output from the browser from an image sequence to a video using a tool like Premiere / AfterEffects, or other free online resource.

## BIGGAN TRANSITIONS

Someone on Youtube asked if the same effect could be applied to BigGAN. Yes! If you look at Runway, the input specification is a bit different - it wants a z of 140 floats, and a category as the input, and for the output, you will be getting the image as a variable called `generatedOutput`. I've included an example in this repo of how to do this. Just follow the same steps above but load `biggan.html` instead of `index.html`.
